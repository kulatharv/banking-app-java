# Java Banking Application — Console Based Project

A simple and fully functional Banking Management System developed in Core Java using a Console-Based Interface.
This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, user authentication, and transaction management.

# Project Overview
  - The Java Banking Application allows users to:
  - Create an account
  - Login using secure authentication
  - Deposit money
  - Withdraw money
  - Check available balance
  - View transaction history
  - Maintain persistent data storage using serialization

**This project is ideal for:**
  College assignments
  Java mini-projects
  Learning OOP concepts
  Understanding file handling in Java

**Features** 
    1. User Authentication
      - Register using a username and password
      - Passwords are securely hashed before storage
      - Login with credential validation
  
    2. Banking Operations
        - Deposit money
        - Withdraw money (with insufficient balance checks)
        - Check account balance
        - View detailed transaction history
    
    3. Persistent Storage
        - User data stored in a local file using object serialization
        - Automatically loads existing data on startup
        - Automatically saves state after every operation
    
    4. Clean Modular Code
        - User.java → Handles user data & transactions
        - BankSystem.java → Contains all banking logic
        - Utils.java → Password hashing utilities
        - Main.java → Main application (menu-driven program)

**Technologies Used**
Technology	Purpose
Java (Core Java)	Main programming language
OOP Principles	Class, Object, Encapsulation
File Handling (Serialization)	Persistent data storage
SHA-256 Hashing	Secure password management
VS Code / IntelliJ / Eclipse	IDE

🔐 Security Features

Uses SHA-256 Hashing to store passwords (not plain text)

Prevents balance from going below zero

Data is stored in a serialized file to avoid direct editing

🚀 Future Enhancements

Here are additional features that can be added:

Role-based Admin Login

Funds Transfer between users

Loan Module

ATM Simulation

GUI version using Java Swing / JavaFX

Database integration (MySQL / SQLite)
